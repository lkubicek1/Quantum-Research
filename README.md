# Quantum Computing Exploration

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and practical playground for exploring quantum computing technologies.

## Subprojects

### 1. qiskit-hello-world

The `programming/qiskit-hello-world` subproject provides a hands-on introduction to quantum computing, leveraging IBM's Qiskit SDK. In this subproject:

- Initialize and visualize basic quantum circuits.
- Demonstrate fundamental quantum operations, like superposition and entanglement.
- Simulate quantum circuits to understand their behavior.

View the project [here](./programming/qiskit-hello-world/emulate-circuit.ipynb). It was inspired and structured following this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrUTwq5jKM4).

### 2. (More projects to come...)

## Objectives

- Understand the architecture and limitations of contemporary quantum computing technologies.
- Derive insights from existing research
- Offer hands-on tutorials and guides, like the `qiskit-hello-world` subproject, to bridge the gap between theory and application.
